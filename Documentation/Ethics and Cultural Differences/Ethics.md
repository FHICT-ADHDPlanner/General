# Ethics
When people think of software development, they often do not immediately think about ethics. With the ethics mainly overlooked, this does mean that there are many unethical practices in software on a daily basis. Some of these may be small and not necessarily malicious, many will be bigger and not as innocent. 

One of these unethical practices is the misleadings advertisements for mobile games. These advertisements are all over the internet but do not actually show what the real game is going to be. This way the developers are trying to get consumers to download the game and make money off of it. 

An example of this is:<br>

## Software Engineering Code of Ethics
In 1997 a Software Engineering Code was published by Don Gotterbarn, Keith Miller and Simon Rogerson in co-operation with the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery). This guide is still used today as the worlds leaging guideline for scientific societies around the world. It addresses the most common ethical malpractices in software engineering. In short it has eight principles, these are as follows:
1. Public
> Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest,
2. Client and Employer
> Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interest of thier client and employer, consistent with the public interest.
3. Product
> Software engineers shall ensure that their product and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
4. Judgement
> Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgement.
5. Management
> Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance. 
6. Profession
> Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.
7. Colleagues
> Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
8. Self
> Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.

## The importance of ethics in software engineering
It may not immediately be clear why ethics may be so important in software engineering. However, when one starts looking deeper into what that software actually does and how it influences our lives, it may become clearer. Since the invention of the internet it has grown in a lot of ways. From games to social media to websites. It can make hugh impacts on people's lives, privacy and data. The data part of this is an important part to note, as we give a lot of sensitive data to applications and, through those applications, also to businesses. For this reason it is of the utmost importance to uphold a high standard of ethical engineering which should be taught to everyone in the profession. 

## How does ethics impact my project?
For my project I chose to make a planning construct specially geared towards people with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, more commonly known by its abbreviation, ADHD. As with each software program that is geared towards people with conditions, there are some ethic hurdles we have to discuss.

First of all is the privacy hurdle. As the user is inputting sensitive user data, how can we ensure that this data is secure and will not be leaked? Options within this are, giving an external service who specialises in this the authority to deal with the user data. Or the second option which is what was chosen for this particular project, is giving Auth0 the authority over the user authorization and user data. Auth0 is a widely trusted platform that upholds ehtical practices and ensures a safe data storage. 

The second hurdle that is pretty major is the monetization and if this is actually needed. There are multiple ways this could be done.
1. A subscription payment for the users where they pay monthly/yearly for the service.
2. Monetization through advertising on the application itself.
