## Abstract

## Introduction
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is usually diagnosed in childhood, with 75% of the diagnosis persisting into adolescense. Around 4 to 6% of adolescents have been diagnosed with ADHD. However, this is the age range where most people are either studying in higher education or working. This means that the disorder can start manifesting itself in new ways, as there are different responsibilities and expectations (ADHD in Adults: A practival guid to evaluation and management, page 156; An Exploratory Investigation of Goal Management; Predictors of Response and Mechanisms of Change in an Organizational Skills Intervention for Students with ADHD). 

The hyperactive and impulsivity facets of the disorder regularly decline during the transition between childhood and adolescense. The attention facet often remains constant or get amplified. The attention deficit often expresses itself in academic and professional situations. The deficit can be a concern, however it is often paired with hyperfocus. When there is an hyperfocus present, it can be trying to focus on anything else but the hyperfocus subject (Testing the relation between ADHD and hyperfocus experiences). This functions the same when in a social enviroment. People with ADHD often have trouble picking up on social cues and continuing conversations if it is not about their prevered subject (Social cognition in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD))

Another facet to consider is the executive disfunction one, which can reflect in poor planning, judgement and emotional control. Executive funtion is referencing the capability to self-regulate. This is the facet that this research is going to be focused on, as it is responsible for the capability to plan, gain gratification, persistence of intention, control of attention and mood (Executive functions in adult with ADHD; ADHD in Adults: A practival guid to evaluation and management, page 156; ).

The challenges that adolescents with ADHD face are often within their jobs or academics, in part due to poor organisation of time and trouble maintaining routines. These challenges are often met with taking medication to lessen the symptomes of the disorder. However, this is not an option for everyone due to the side effects. This warrents looking for a different options. Another option is therapy, such as Goal Management Training. This can help people with ADHD set goals and manage their projects (Organizational-skills interventions in the treatment of ADHD; An Exploratory Investigation of Goal Management). 

Nonetheless, there is not a tool geared specifically towards people with ADHD to customize to their liking, to set goals in and manage what their are working on. The goal of this research is to determine, between a pool of participants, what people with ADHD want within management tool and how they prefer to plan their day, week or project. 

The main research question in this instance is "**What ways of project management work for individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder?**"

This main question can be divided in subquestions:
- What motivates someone with ADHD to plan?
- How does colour use affect planning?
- What is a more effective way of showing a planning, a day, week or month view and why?
- How does a list of repeating tasks influence the way people with ADHD plan?

## Materials and Method
To get answers to the subquestions and eventually the main question, a survey will be conveyed amongst people with adhd. This survey will consist of multiple questions per subquestion to get a clear overview of the needs and wants of the target audience.
