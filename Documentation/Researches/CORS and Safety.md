## **Introduction**
**C**ross-**O**rigin **R**esource **S**haring (CORS) is a vital part in any web based application. As it is such an important part, this research will be focussing on what CORS is and how it impacts the safety of applications.

The topic of this research was sparked by issues within my individual project, ADHD-planner. While connecting the React Typescript frontend to the C# backend, issues came up regarding CORS and the connection it made. Since this is a vital part of the application made, it was decided that it would make a good research topic.

## **Methodology**
This research will take a better look into CORS. The main research question that will be answered is as follows:
>How can a developer safely use CORS in their web application?

To help answer this question, it has been split into multiple sub questions:

1. What is CORS?
2. What are the safety issues with allowing all CORS communication?
3. How can a developer only let certain CORS communication through?

### **Research Strategies**
The research will be conducted using the DOT (**D**evelopment **O**riented **T**riangulation) framework. For the questions, the following research strategies will be used:
| Research Question | Research Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| <b>(1)</b> What is CORS? | Internet-research |
| <b>(2)</b> What are the safety issues with allowing all CORS communication? | Internet-research |
| <b>(3)</b> How can a developer only let certain CORS communication through? | Internet-research |

### **Instruments**
Instruments are used to manage and conduct the research. In this research only the following instrument will be used:
- ADHD-planner application

This applicationwill be used as an example project where CORS will be used. 

### **Limitations**
The one limitation that this research has is that it will be limited to the type of application, in this case: React and ASP.NET applications. This might mean that the research will not be as usefull for everyone as the CORS methods might differ between application types.

## **Results**
> ### What is CORS?



> ### What are the safety issues with allowing all CORS communication


> ### How can a developer only let certain CORS communication through?
