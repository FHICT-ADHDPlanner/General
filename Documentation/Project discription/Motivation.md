# Motivation
All around me I have hear of people with add having trouble with planning out their task for the day, or planning in general. A lot of people with ADHD either do not want to do it at all or do not have the right tools to do so. The focus point of this IP project is going to be the aforementioned problem. Every person with ADHD has different needs in a planner or to do list. Some may prefer to only plan out one day, or a part of the day. Others may want to plan out their entire week or only set up rough guidelines. They often want to be able to move tasks around or be creative with how they plan their tasks. Some might also need a reminder of the task that still need to be done. Either way, a rigid planner will not work for most, if not all, of them and thus flexibility within the planner is needed.

The goal is not to make people with ADHD plan. It is, however, the goal to give those who want an overview of the tasks or a rough guideline for the week a tool to do so. A tool that is customizable and fully fitted to their need. Of course there will be research done on what different people with ADHD might want or need within a planner, how they might want to structure their day and if they want to be able to plan ahead. All of this will be included in the design of the planner
