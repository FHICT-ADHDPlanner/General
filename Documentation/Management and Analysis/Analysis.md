#### Individual:
What is a business process?

 

How a business process relates to software applications?

 


#### Group:
You have analysed and modelled an existing business process from your project prior to the introduction of the software that you are creating. Your model visualizes the process, including information aspects (data used / produced in the activities), and roles (who does which activity).

 

You have analysed the process and drew conclusions on possible improvements in it (by means of introduction of your application).

 

You have modelled the new process including data and role aspects in it and explained which activities are automated or supported by your application how this changes the work of the roles involved in the process.

 


#### Project:
Does your software automate a task, facilitate a task, or make a new task possible to perform?

 

Which is the process that your software supports / automate? Can you visualize it in a diagram?

 

Which roles are involves in this process? The work of which people (their roles) will this software influence?

 

Which steps of the process does your software support / automate? Can you visualize the new process in a diagram?

 


### Requirements analysis

#### Individual:
What are non-functional requirements?

 

How do you specify functional and non-functional requirements in your agile method and how do you validate them?

 

When do you elicit and specify the requirements in your agile method? Are you allowed to change or update them?

 


#### Group:
You have contributed to the requirements collection and elicitation.

 

You have contributed to the translation of the requirements to User stories.

 

You have contributed to the translation of the requirements to the project architecture and designs.

#### Individual:
What is ethics in software engineering?

 

Why is ethics important in software engineering?

 

What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work?

 

How do you know that your ethical considerations match with those of other software engineers?

 


#### Group:
You have made an analysis of the ethical aspects of your application.

 


#### Project:
Which ethical aspects play a role in your project?

 

Do you foresee ethical conflicts caused by your software? What kind of?

 

Can you do something to avoid or minimize these conflicts?
