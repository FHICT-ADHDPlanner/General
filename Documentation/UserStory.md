# Epic
As a person with ADHD I want to be able to plan my time better, so my days are more structured and less chaotic. 


# User Stories
As a user I want to be able to log in, so I can see my own personal planning.

*Scenario*: The user adds in their emailaddress and password and clicks log in.

            Given that the emailaddress and password is correct.
            When I click the log in button. 
            Then I should be logged into the application.
