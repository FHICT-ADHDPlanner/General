"As a user, I want to be able to click on a task in the calendar, edit it, and add subtasks so that I can better organize my tasks and break them down into smaller, more manageable pieces."

To implement this user story, we can follow these steps:

- When the user clicks on the task, open a modal window that allows the user to see the task details. 
- Add an "edit" button, which allows the user to edit the task details, such as the task name, due date, and description.
- Add an " Add subtasks" section to the detail modal window that allows the user to add subtasks to the task.
- When the user saves the changes, update the task and its subtasks in the database.
