# Learning Outcomes

#### LO 1
**You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.**

User friendly: 	You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques.

Full-stack: 	You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (Javascript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g. Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues.

Weeks 1 and 2:
I have done research into what frontend I will end up using. I looked into Angular, Spring and React Typescript/Javascript. In the end, I chose to use React Typescript due to it still having type declaration and a wide userbase. Next to the frontend, I also had to pick a backend language. In the past semesters C# was the most used language. I decided to stick with this as it has the lowest learning curve and thus be faster to work with while learning a new frontend language. 

Weeks 3, 4 and 5:
A start has been made with an API using ASP.NET Core Web API. At the end of week 5, there is a partially working API with the ability to make a task. Besides this Auth0 was used to create a login system. I chose to use Auth0 because it is well documented and thus more managable. I chose not to make a login system myself as this is a more efficient way of working.
The frontend got a navigation bar and a button for logging in and out.

Weeks 6, 7 and 8:
The API had more functionalities added, a desciption can be added and a timer can be set. Besides just looking at this part of the API, I also looked at a way of connecting the API to the frontend which worked. 
The frontend got a modal where a new task could be set, a start was made with intergrating a calendar into the frontend so it would be usable. 
A database was set up using entity framework. Which is now connected to the API. 

Weeks 9, 10 and 11: 



#### LO 2
**You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.**

Tooling and methodology: 	Carry out, monitor and report on unit integration, regression and system tests, with attention for security and performance aspects, as well as applying static code analysis and code reviews.

Weeks 1 and 2:
A little bit of research has been done into what goes into testing a frontend.

Weeks 3, 4 and 5:
A start has been made to look into unit tests and how an API can be tested. Together with looking into mocking a database. 

Weeks 6, 7, 8:
The first unit tests were made and a start with mocking the database has been made. This has to be further explored and worked out still. 

#### LO 3
**You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project.**

Choose: 	You are aware of the most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. Your choice of a method is motivated and based on well-defined selection criteria and context analyses.

Week 1 and 2:
Multiple ways of agile were looked at. For example, Jira, Monday, Trello and Azure DevOps. The chose was made to use AzureDevops to keep clear what should still be made but also to keep track of sprints. The decision was made to keep the sprints short at 3 weeks. This way the sprints are not too long but the works is still managable. 

Weeks 3, 4 and 5:
Planning in the sprints is still a bit difficult. Either too much work is put in a sprint and it has to be carried over to the next sprint or too little work is planned in. A middle ground has to be found here.

Weeks 6, 7 and 8:
Planning the sprint is getting slightly easier. There is still some work that has to be carried over but not nearly as much adjusting as in the first 2 sprints. 

#### LO 4
**You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.**

Design and implement: 	You design a release process and implement a continuous integration and deployment solution (using e.g. Gitlab CI and Docker).

Weeks 1 and 2:
This subject has not really come to mind yet as we are still just starting out

Weeks 3, 4 and 5:
I took a look at GitHub Actions to set up Continues Integration. How this worked was pretty self-explanatory.
A decision to use Docker was made. This will be used to the deployment. The plan is to actually deploy it. 

Weeks 6, 7 and 8: 
This sprint I set up docker in the backend project. A container can now be deployed and works. 

#### LO 5
**You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.**

Recognize : 	Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering.

Take into account : 	Adapt your communication, working, and behavior styles to reflect project stakeholders from different cultures; Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.

Weeks 1 and 2:
This will be demonstrated in the groupproject, as we do have an international student in our group. The deepdive will be done in a later sprint.

Weeks 3, 4 and 5:
A littler research was done into cultural differences between Dutch and other cultures. Mostly focussing on countries still nearby. More research will be done into other cultures that are big in the IT sector. 

Weeks 6, 7 and 8:
A document has been set up and still needs to be worked out. 

#### LO 6
**You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques.**

Multiple types of test techniques : 	You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.

Weeks 1 and 2:
There is not much to test yet in the Individual nor Group project. However, the plan is to involve users in the development of the application in the individual project. For the group project mostly stakeholder feedback will be used.

Weeks 3, 4 and 5:
There was feedback from the stakeholders on how the application was build up and how it was gonna look. In response to this Mockups will be made for them to give feedback on and for us to use. 

Weeks 6, 7 and 8: 
A small population of users has been asked what they would like to see and what would work best for them in the Individual project. The data from this will be used to make some Mockups which will be shown for feedback again. This way the application will work the best for the target audience. 

#### LO 7
**You analyze and describe simple business processes that are related to your project.**

Simple : 	Involving stakeholders, predominantly sequential processes with one or two alternative paths.

Related : 	
Business processes during which the software that you are developing will be used (business processes that the software must support by fully or partially automating them).

or

Business processes needed for the success of your software development project (e.g., product release, market release, financial assurance).


#### LO 8
**You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.**

Professional manner : 	You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions. You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.

Weeks 1 and 2:
There has been a meeting with the productowner for the groupproject. Most of the backlog has been set up and some adjustments have been made according to the feedback given.

Weeks 3, 4 and 5:
Multiple meetings have been set up to fine tune the backlog, getting feedback on the technologies planned and the first prototype.

Weeks 6, 7, and 8:
The first sprint delivery has been had with the productowner. There was feedback about some of the design choices and what we were planning on using. This feedback was taken and used to make mockups. Which have been send to the company for approval and feedback.
