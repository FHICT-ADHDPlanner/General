# Motivation
All around I have heard about people with ADHD having trouble with making a plan for the day or planning in general. They either do not want to do this but do not have the right tool to do it. This is the problem that is going to be the focus point of the IP project. Every person with ADHD has different needs in a planner, some only want to plan for one day, others might want to plan out the whole week in rough lines. They often want to be able to move tasks around, be reminded of tasks still do to or be creative with how they plan their tasks. Due to this, a rigid planner will not work for most, if not all, of them. 

The goal is not to make people with ADHD plan, however it is the goal to give those who do want an overview of the tasks they have to do or want to make a loose plan for the week a tool to do so. A tool that is customizable and fully fit to their need. There will be research done on what different people with ADHD want within a planner, how they want to structure their day and if they want to be able to plan ahead. This will be included in the design of the planner.
